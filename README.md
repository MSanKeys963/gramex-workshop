# Overview

This workshop aims to teach you how:
- modern ML Apps are built, with a practical example
- low-code approaches make this fast and flexible
- micro-services make it easier to extend applications

# What is Gramex?

A visual analytics platform to build data-based web apps with less code. More info [here](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/).

# How to use Gramex?

You can install Gramex on your machine using [this](https://gramener.com/gramex/guide/install/) or you can use online IDE [here](https://gramex.gramener.com/).

# About the files

1. `admissions.csv` is the dataset file used throughout the workshop.
2. `gramex.yaml` is the `YAML` configuration file for setting up Gramex on your machine locally.
3. `index.html` contains boilerplate code for building the web-app.
